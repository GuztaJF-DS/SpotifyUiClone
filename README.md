# Spotify Ui Clone

An Kinda Clone of the Spotify Ui for studing purposes

## Summary

This is a project made in React Js, so the idea is to make an UI for a music streaming app, like Spotify, but not a direct copy of the spotify UI, the idea is analyze the UI and try to make something with the same amount of featues, except for the ability to play songs, since i don't have any of the right of these songs (also maybe i shouldn't use their name and covers), But i plan to do the rest, like create playlists, save songs, create users, and these type of stuff.

## To Do
